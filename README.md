# Ubuntu AD DC
This is an automated AD DC setup for Ubuntu for anyone that wants to run their own AD DC at home but does not want to deal with Microsoft licensing or Windows Server period.

## Requirements
All you really need done before running this script are:
- A static IP
- Valid Hostname including the domain you will use, ex. dc.linuxman.co
